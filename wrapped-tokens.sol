// "Wrapped tokens" are crypto assets that represent another cryptocurrency, 
// typically on a different blockchain. They’re used to make otherwise incompatible blockchains interoperable.


// A wrapped token is like a "copy" or representation of a crypto asset on another blockchain.


// Because most blockchains can't talk to each other directly. You can’t use Bitcoin on Ethereum out of the box — they’re different systems.
// Wrapped tokens allow you to:
// Use BTC in DeFi apps on Ethereum (like lending/borrowing).
// Trade across chains more easily.
// Increase liquidity across ecosystems.
