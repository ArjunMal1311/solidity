# What we are going to do

1. A protocol that allows user to deposit into a valut and in return, receive rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance
2. Rebase token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time
(Balance increases linearly with time, mint tokens to our users every time they perform an action like minting, burning, transferring etc or bridging also)

3. Interest Rate (Individually set an interest rate for each user abased on global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits to the contract)
(can be based on early adopters)
(Increase token adoption)
