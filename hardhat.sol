// Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum. It provides a local blockchain, a development console, and a testing framework.
// It is a development tool that allows you to deploy, test, and debug your smart contracts.


// Smart contract testing is the process of verifying that the code of a smart contract works as expected. 
// Testing is useful for checking if a particular smart contract satisfies requirements for reliability, usability, and security.
// Rigorous testing can, however, help you discover defects and issues in a smart contract's code early and fix them before launching on Mainnet.


// Testing methods
// Unit Testing - Unit testing evaluates contract functions separately and checks that each component works correctly. 
//                Good unit tests should be simple, quick to run and provide a clear idea of what went wrong if tests fail.

// Integration Testing -  Integration testing can detect issues arising from cross-contract calls or interactions between different 
//                        functions in the same smart contract. For example, integration tests can help check if things like inheritance and dependency injection work properly.

// Functional Testing - Functional testing is a type of testing that focuses on the functionality of a smart contract. 
//                      It is used to ensure that the smart contract behaves as expected under different conditions.





// Pyramid
// on the top we have Manual Testing
