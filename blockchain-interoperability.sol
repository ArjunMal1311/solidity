// Blockchain Interoperability

// Interoperability is the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other.
// Users can transfer assets and information between different blockchains without needing centralized exchanges
// Interoperability allows for greater collaboration like bitcoin is good for security and ethereum is good for smart contracts


// transactions between blockchains can be completed without costly intermediaries or lon processing times
// enables multi token wallets, croos chain smart contracts and decentralized finance applications that work across multiple blockchains


// How does it work?
// 1. Cross Chain Communication Protocols like IBC or Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol
// 2. Atomic Swaps -> direct peer to peer transactions between two blockchains without intermediaries
// 3. Wrapped Tokens -> Representation of one blockchain's token on another blockchain like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum
// 4. Sidechains & Bridges -> Separate blockchains that are connected to a main chain like Polygon bridge enables asset transfers between Ethereum and Polygon


// Some Risks
// Different Protocols – Each blockchain has unique consensus mechanisms and architectures.
// Security Risks – Cross-chain interactions may introduce vulnerabilities.
// Scalability Issues – Managing multiple blockchains efficiently can be complex.
// Lack of Standards – No universal communication protocol yet exists.
