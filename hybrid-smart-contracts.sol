// Hybrid Smart Contracts

// Combines on chain infrastructure with off chain data and computation provided by decentralized oracle networks
// in order to create feature rich applications (decentralized)


// DON - Decentralized Oracle Network


// On-chain code runs in an extremely secure and limited-functionality blockchain environment with a 
// reduced attack surface area, providing users a high degree of execution and storage determinism—the 
// code will run exactly as written and results will remain permanently and immutably stored. 
// Conversely, DONs run off-chain and thus offer infinitely more functionality flexibility and 
// data accessibility.



// Provide purpose-built decentralized services to specific applications, although some users may share 
// the costs of the same DON service (e.g., numerous DeFi protocols currently use and fund the 
// Chainlink ETH/USD Price Feed Oracle)


// WORKING
// Fetch, validate, secure, and deliver data from external APIs to smart contracts running on blockchains and layer-2 solutions
// Perform various types of computations for smart contracts running on blockchains and layer-2 solutions
// Relay outputs of smart contract code to other blockchains or external systems


// Working
// 1. Keeper Network - automation bots that regularly maintain and update smart contracts
// 2. Off Chain Reporting (OCR) - scalable aggregation of oracle node responses in DON that are the delivered on chain in a single
// transaction to reduce on chain costs
// 3. Scalable Computation - high throughput and low latency data processing and analysis
// 4. Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) - generate random numbers on chain that are cryptographically secure and tamper-resistant
// 5. Data & Computation Privacy
// 6. On Chain Contract Privacy - Transaction privacy for a smart contract's inputs and outputs



// On chain Blockchain works different
// 1. It maintains a persistent ledger recording authoritative custody of users’ assets. It also interacts with private keys
// 2. It processes irreversible transactions transferring value between users and executes the final settlement 
// 3. It secures the proper functioning of the DON’s off-chain services by providing dispute resolution and guardrails
